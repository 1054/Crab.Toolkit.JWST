When there are only two valid images covering some pixels, the outlier detection can not remove hot pixels.
By examining the i2d (intermediate product when setting `outlier_detection.in_memory=False`), median and blot images, 
the median image does not make sense. 

I checked that in "lib/python3.9/site-packages/jwst/outlier_detection/outlier_detection.py", 
the median image is calculated as:

    median_image[row1:row2] = np.nanmedian(resampled_sci, axis=0)

Then I tested that 

    np.nanmedian([0.0, 5.0])  #--> 2.5
    np.nanmedian([0.0, 5.0, np.nan])  #--> 2.5

which surprized me! Median should not act as mean when there are only two images! 

Ideally, in this case, we weould better to have the smaller value as the 'median' 
of the two values, so that hot pixels with a high value will be easily rejected later
because it is far away from the 'median'. 

Therefore, I hacked the code to implement the above optimzed two-value-median:

+                #<20230614><DZLIU># np.nanmedian([5.0, 0.0]) -> 2.5 ?!
+                where_two_elements = (np.count_nonzero(np.isfinite(resampled_sci), axis=0) == 2)
+                where_two_elements_mask = np.repeat(where_two_elements[np.newaxis, :, :], resampled_sci.shape[0], axis=0)
+                min_of_two_elements = np.nanmin(resampled_sci, axis=0)
+                for iframe in range(resampled_sci.shape[0]):
+                    resampled_sci[iframe][where_two_elements] = min_of_two_elements[where_two_elements]
+                #<20230614><DZLIU>#
